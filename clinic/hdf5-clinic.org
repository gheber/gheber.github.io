** Your questions
*** [[https://github.com/steven-varga/h5rnd][h5rnd]]
- **Question:** How are generated HDF5 objects named?  An integer name, or can a
  randomized string be used?
  - =h5rnd= Generates a pool of random strings as link names
  - Uniform length distribution between 5 and 30 over =[a-z][A-Z]=
- **Question:** Does it create multi-dimensional datasets with a rich set of
  HDF5 datatypes?  Compound datatypes, perhaps?
  - Currently, it creates 1,000 element 1D FP64 datasets (w/ attribute)
  - RE: types - anything is possible. Budget?
- **Question:** Are named datatypes generated? If not, are these reasonable
  types of extensions for =h5rnd=?
  - Not currently, but anything is possible
*** Other questions?

** Last week's highlights
*** Forum
**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/external-link-access-in-parallel-hdf5-1-12-0/8219][External link access in parallel HDF5 1.12.0]]
- Can't access externally linked datasets in parallel; fine in 1.10.x and in serial
- It appears that someone encountered a known bug in the field
- Dev. claim it's fixed in =develop=, waiting for confirmation from the user

**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/h5i-dec-ref-hangs/8104][=H5I_dec_ref= hangs]]
- [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5I_DEC_REF][=H5Idec_ref=]] is one of those functions that needs to be used w/ extra care
- Using =mpi4py= and =h5py=
- User provided an MWE (in Python) and, honestly, there is limited help we can
  offer (as we are neither =mpi4py= nor =h5py= experts)
- A C or C++ MWE might be the better starting point

**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/h5diff-exits-with-1-but-doesnt-print-differences/6872][=h5diff= exits with 1 but doesn’t print differences]]
- Case of out-of-date/poor documentation
- [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/h5diff][=h5diff=]] is perhaps the most complex tool (multi-graph comparison + what does
  ~'='~ mean?)
- Writing code is the easy part
- We need to do better

**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/independent-datasets-for-mpi-processes-progress/8202][Independent datasets for MPI processes. Progress?]]
- Need some clarification on the problem formulation
- Current status (w/ MPI) MD-modifying ops. must be collective
- On the horizon: asynchronous operations (ASYNC VOL)

** Your questions
*** How to use ~H5Ocopy~ in C++ code?
- [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/how-to-use-h5copy-in-c-code/8175][Forum post]]
  #+begin_quote
  sandhya.v250 (Feb 19)

  Hello Team, I want to copy few groups from one hdf5 file to hdf5 another file
  which is not yet created and this should be done inside the C++ code..can you
  please tell me how can I use this inside this tool
#+end_quote

- The [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5O_COPY][function in question]]  (there is also a tool called =h5copy=):
  #+begin_src C

herr_t H5Ocopy
(
 hid_t       src_loc_id,
 const char* src_name,
 hid_t       dst_loc_id,
 const char* dst_name,
 hid_t       ocpypl_id,
 hid_t       lcpl_id
);

#+end_src

- The emphasis  appears to be on C++
  - You can do this in C. It's just more boilerplate.
  - Whenever I need something C++, I turn to my colleague Steven Varga (=
    Mr. [[http://h5cpp.org/][H5CPP]])
  - He also created a nice [[https://github.com/steven-varga/h5rnd][random HDF5 file generator/tester]] (= 'Prüfer' in
    German)

*** Steven's solution (excerpt)

The full example can be downloaded from [[https://github.com/steven-varga/HDFGroup-mailinglist/tree/master/object-copy-2021-feb-18][here]].

**Basic idea:** Visit all objects in the source via ~H5Ovisit~ and invoke
~H5Ocopy~ in the callback.

#+begin_src C++ -N

#include "argparse.h"
#include <h5cpp/all>
#include <string>

herr_t ocpy_callback(hid_t src, const char *name, const H5O_info_t *info,
                     void *dst_) {
  hid_t* dst = static_cast<hid_t*>(dst_);
  int err = 0;
  switch( info->type ){
  case H5O_TYPE_GROUP:
    if(H5Lexists( *dst, name, H5P_DEFAULT) >= 0)
      err = H5Ocopy(src, name, *dst, name, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
    break;
  case H5O_TYPE_DATASET:
    err = H5Ocopy(src, name, *dst, name, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
    break;
  default: /*H5O_TYPE_NAMED_DATATYPE, H5O_TYPE_NTYPES, H5O_TYPE_UNKNOWN */
    ; // nop to keep compiler happy
  }
  return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  argparse::ArgumentParser arg("ocpy", "0.0.1");
  arg.add_argument("-i", "--input")
    .required().help("path to input hdf5 file");
  arg.add_argument("-s", "--source")
    .default_value(std::string("/"))
    .help("path to group within hdf5 container");
  arg.add_argument("-o", "--output").required()

    output = arg.get<std::string>("--output");
    source = arg.get<std::string>("--source");
    destination = arg.get<std::string>("--destination");

    h5::fd_t fd_i = h5::open(input, H5F_ACC_RDONLY);

                           H5P_DEFAULT)}
        : h5::gr_t{H5Gopen(fd_i, gname, H5P_DEFAULT)};
      H5Ovisit(sgr, H5_INDEX_CRT_ORDER, H5_ITER_NATIVE, ocpy_callback, &dgr );
    } else

*** Parting thoughts
- This is can be tricky business depending on how selective you want to be
- ~H5Ovisit~ visits /objects/ and does not account for dangling links, etc.
- ~H5Ocopy~'s behavior is highly customizable. Check the options & play w/
  =h5copy= to see the effect!

*** More Questions
**** Question 1
#+begin_quote
I have an unrelated question. I have 7,000 HDF5 files, each 500 MB long. When I
use them, should I open them selectively, when I need them, or is it
advantageous to make one big file, or to open virtual files? I am interested in
the speed of the different approaches.
#+end_quote

- 40 GbE connectivity
- 10 contiguously laid out Datasets per file => ~50 MB per dataset
- Always reading full datasets
- **Considerations:**
  - If you have the RAM and use all data in an "epoch" just read whole files and
    use [[https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/Advanced/FileImageOperations/HDF5FileImageOperations.pdf][HDF5 file images]] for "in-memory I/O."
  - You could maintain an index file /I/ which contains external links (one for
    each of the 7,000 files), and a dataset which for each external file and
    dataset contains the offset of the dataset in the file. You would keep /I/
    (small!) in memory and, for each dataset request, read the ~50MB directly
    w/o the HDF5 library. This assumes that no datatype conversion is necessary
    and you have no trouble interpreting the bytes.
  - A variation of the previous approach would be for the stub-file to contain
    HDF5 [[https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/jpss/documents/HDF5_Tutorial_201509/2-3-Working%20with%20collections%20of%20HDF5%20files.pptx.pdf][/virtual datasets/]], datasets stitched together from other
    datasets. This would we a good option, if you wanted to simplify your
    application code and make everything appear as a single large HDF5
    file. It'd be important though to have that (small) stub-file on the clients
    in memory to not incur a high latency penalty.
  - Both approaches can be easily parallelized, assuming read-only access. If
    there are writers involved, it's still doable, but additional considerations
    apply.

#+begin_quote
Another question: what is the recommended way to combine Python with C++ with
C++ reading in and working on large hdf5 files that require a lot of speed.
#+end_quote

- To be honest, we ran out of time and I (GH) didn't fully grasp the question.
- Steven said something about Julia
- Henric uses Boost Python.  What about Cython?
- What's the access pattern?

** Appendix
*** The =h5copy= command line tool

#+begin_example
gerd@guix ~$ h5copy

usage: h5copy [OPTIONS] [OBJECTS...]
   OBJECTS
      -i, --input        input file name
      -o, --output       output file name
      -s, --source       source object name
      -d, --destination  destination object name
   OPTIONS
      -h, --help         Print a usage message and exit
      -p, --parents      No error if existing, make parent groups as needed
      -v, --verbose      Print information about OBJECTS and OPTIONS
      -V, --version      Print version number and exit
      --enable-error-stack
                  Prints messages from the HDF5 error stack as they occur.
      -f, --flag         Flag type

      Flag type is one of the following strings:

      shallow     Copy only immediate members for groups

      soft        Expand soft links into new objects

      ext         Expand external links into new objects

      ref         Copy references and any referenced objects, i.e., objects
                  that the references point to.
                    Referenced objects are copied in addition to the objects
                  specified on the command line and reference datasets are
                  populated with correct reference values. Copies of referenced
                  datasets outside the copy range specified on the command line
                  will normally have a different name from the original.
                    (Default:Without this option, reference value(s) in any
                  reference datasets are set to NULL and referenced objects are
                  not copied unless they are otherwise within the copy range
                  specified on the command line.)

      noattr      Copy object without copying attributes

      allflags    Switches all flags from the default to the non-default setting

      These flag types correspond to the following API symbols

      H5O_COPY_SHALLOW_HIERARCHY_FLAG
      H5O_COPY_EXPAND_SOFT_LINK_FLAG
      H5O_COPY_EXPAND_EXT_LINK_FLAG
      H5O_COPY_EXPAND_REFERENCE_FLAG
      H5O_COPY_WITHOUT_ATTR_FLAG
      H5O_COPY_ALL

** Notes
*** What (if any) are the ACID properties of HDF5 operations?
**** Split-state
The state of an open (for RW) HDF5 file is /split/ between RAM and persistent
storage. Often the partial states will be out of sync. In the event of a
"catastrophic" failure (power outage, application crash, system crash), it is
impossible to predict what the partial state on disk will be.

#+begin_src plantuml :hidden :file hdf5-file-state.png
skinparam componentStyle rectangle

package "HDF5 File State" {
  database "Disk" {
    [Partial State 1]
  }
  cloud "RAM" {
    [Partial State 2]
  }
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:hdf5-file-state.png]]

**** Non-transactional
The main reason why it is impossible to predict the outcome is that HDF5
operations are non-transactional. By 'transaction' I mean a collection of
operations (and the effects of their execution) on the physical and abstract
application state. In particular, there are no concepts of beginning a
transaction, a commit, or a roll-back. Since they are not transactional, it is
not straightforward to speak about the ACID properties of HDF5 operations.

**** File system facilities
People sometimes speak about ACID properties with respect to file system
operations. Although the HDF5 library relies on file system operations for the
implementation of HDF5 operations, the correspondence is not as direct as
might wish. For example, what appears as a single HDF5 operation to the user
often includes multiple file system operations. Several file system operations
have a certain property only at the level of a single operation, but not
multiple operations combined.

**** ACID
- Atomicity :: All changes to an HDF5 file's state must complete or fail as a
  whole unit.
  - Supported in HDF5? **No.**
  - Some file systems only support single op. atomicity, if at all.
  - A lot of HDF5 operations are /in-place/; mixed success -> impossible to
    recover
- Consistency :: An operation is a correct transformation of the HDF5 file's
  state.
  - Supported in HDF5? **Yes and No**
  - Depends on one's definition of HDF5 file/object integrity constraints
  - Assuming we are dealing with a correct program
  - Special case w/ multiple processes: Single Writer Multiple Reader
- Isolation (serialization) :: Even though operations execute concurrently, it
appears to each operation, OP, that others executed either before OP or after
  OP, but not both.
  - Supported in HDF5? **No.**
  - Depends on concurrency scenario and requires special configuration (e.g.,
    MT, MPI).
  - Time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability
- Durability :: Once an operation completes successfully, it's changes to the
  file's state survive failure.
  - Supported in HDF5? **No.**
  - "Split brain"
  - No transaction log
