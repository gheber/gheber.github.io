** Your questions
*** Question 1
We have observed that reading a dataset with variable-length ASCII strings and
setting the read mem. type to =H5T_C_S1 (size=H5T_VARIABLE /
cset=H5T_CSET_UTF8)=, produces an error with =“H5T.c line 4893 in
H5T__path_find_real(): no appropriate function for conversion path”=. However,
if we read first another dataset of the same file that contains UTF8 strings and
then the same dataset with ASCII strings, no errors are returned whatsoever and
the content seems to be retrieved. Is this an expected behaviour, or are we
missing something?
- As a side note, the same situation can be replicated by setting the cset to
  =H5T_CSET_ASCII= and opening first the ASCII-based dataset before the
  UTF8-dataset, or any other combination, as long as the first call succeeded
  (e.g., opening the ASCII dataset with =cset=H5T_CSET_ASCII=, then opening the
  same ASCII dataset with =cset=H5T_CSET_UTF8= also seems to work).
- Tested using HDF5 v1.10.7, v1.12.0, and manually compiling the most recent
  commit on the official GitHub repository. The code was compiled with GCC
  9.3.0 + HPE-MPI v2.22, but no MPI file access property was given (i.e., using
  =H5P_DEFAULT= to avoid MPI-IO).
- Further information: https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues/544

*** Forum
**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/how-can-attributes-of-an-existing-object-be-modified/8319][How can attributes of an existing object be modified?]]
- There are several different "namespaces" in HDF5
- Examples:
  - Global (=file-level) path names
  - Per object attribute names
  - Per compound type field names
  - Etc.
- Some have constraints such as reserved characters, character encoding, length,
  etc.
- Most importantly, they are disjoint and /don't mix/
  - Disambiguation would be too costly, if not impossible
**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/hdf5dotnet-library/8314][HDF5DotNet library]]
- There's perhaps a place for wrappers of the HDF5 C-API and and independent .NET native (=full-managed) solution (e.g., [[https://github.com/Apollo3zehn/HDF5.NET][HDF5.NET]])
- [[http://swig.org/][SWIG]] (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) has come a long way
  - Should that be the path forward for [[https://github.com/HDFGroup/HDF.PInvoke][HDF.PInvoke]]
  - We need greater automation and (.NET) platform independence
  - Focus on testing
  - Any thoughts/comments?

**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/parallel-hdf5-write-with-irregular-size-in-one-dimension/8284][Parallel HDF5 write with irregular size in one dimension]]
- Posted an example that shows how different ranks can write varying amounts of
  data to a chunked dataset in parallel. Some ranks don't write any data. The
  chunk size is chosen arbitrarily.
** Tips & tricks
*** The "mystery" of the HDF5 file format
- The specification published [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/File+Format+Specification][here]] can seem overwhelming. Part of the problem is
  that you are seeing at least three versions layered on top of each other.
- The [[https://hdf5.io/develop/_f_m_t1.html][first (?) release]] was a lot simpler, and has all the core ideas
- Once you've digested that, you are ready for the [[https://hdf5.io/develop/_s_p_e_c.html][other releases]] and consider
  writing your own (de-)serializer
- Don't get carried away: only a tiny fraction of the HDF5 library's code deals
  w/ serialization

*** Forum
**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/how-to-convert-xml-to-hdf5/8279][How to convert XML to HDF5]]
- There is no /canonical/ conversion path, even if you have an XML schema
  - XML is simpler because elements are strictly nested
  - XML can be trickier because of element repetition and the non-obligatory
    nature of certain elements or attributes
- Start w/ a scripting language that has XML (parsing) and HDF5 modules
  - [[https://github.com/akheron/jansson][Jannson]] works well if you prefer C
- Consider XSLT to simplify first
**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/hdf5dotnet-library/8314][HDF5DotNet library]]
- It's been out of maintenance for many years
- _Alternatives_: [[https://www.nuget.org/packages/HDF.PInvoke/][HDF.PInvoke]] (Windows only) and [[https://www.nuget.org/packages/HDF.PInvoke.1.10/][HDF.PInvoke.1.10]] (.NET
  Standard)
  - Both are based on HDF5 1.10.x
- *Note:* We (The HDF Group) are neither C# nor .NET experts. [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke][=PInvoke=]] is about
  the level of abstraction we can handle. We count on and rely on knowledgeable
  community members for advice and contributions.
- There are many interesting community projects, for example, [[https://github.com/Apollo3zehn/HDF5.NET][HDF5.NET]]:
  - Based on the HDF5 file format spec. & no HDF5 library dependence!
**** [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/parallel-hdf5-write-with-irregular-size-in-one-dimension/8284][Parallel HDF5 write with irregular size in one dimension]]
- Many of our examples s..k, and we have to do a lot better
  - Maybe we created them this way to generate more questions? :-/
- HDF5 dataspaces are logical, chunks are physical
  - Write a (logically) correct program first and then optimize performance!

** Tips & tricks
*** Large (> 64 KiB) HDF5 attributes

#+begin_src python

import h5py, numpy as np

with h5py.File('my.h5', 'w', libver='latest') as file:
    file.attrs['random[1024]'] = np.random.random(1024)
    file.attrs['random[1048576]'] = np.random.random(1024*1024)

#+end_src

The =h5dump= output looks like this:

#+begin_example

gerd@guix ~/scratch/run$ h5dump -pBH my.h5
HDF5 "my.h5" {

  - _Use Case_: You are in a corner of an application where all you've got is a

  - See the [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/h5stat][=h5stat=]] output the user provided!
- What contributes to ~H5Iget_name~ being slow?
  - The path names are not stored in an HDF5 file (except in symbolic links...)
    and are created on-demand
  - In general, HDF5 /arrangements/ are not trees, not even directed graphs, but
    directed multi-graphs
    - A node can be the target of multiple edges (including from the same source
      node)
    - Certain nodes (groups) can be source and target of an edge
- *Take-Home-Message:*Unless you are certain that your HDF5 arrangement is a
  tree, you are skating on thin ice with path names!
  - Trying to uniquely identify objects via path name is asking for trouble
    - Use addresses + file IDs (pre-HDF 1.12) or tokens (HDF 1.12+) for that!
- Quincey points out that
  - The library caches metadata that can accelerate ~H5Iget_name~
  - But there are other complications
    - For example, you can have "anonymous" objects (objects that haven't
    been linked to groups in the file. i.e., no path yet)
    - Another source of trouble are objects that have been unlinked

** Tips & tricks
*** How to open an HDF5 in append mode?

To be clear, there is no =H5F*= call that behaves like an append call. But we
can mimic one as follows:

*Credits:* Werner Benger

#+begin_src C -n

hid = H5Fcreate(filename, H5F_ACC_EXCL|H5F_ACC_SWMR_WRITE, fcpl_id, fapl_id);
if (hid < 0)
  {
    hid = H5Fopen(filename, H5F_ACC_RDWR|H5F_ACC_SWMR_WRITE, fapl_id);
  }

if (hid < 0)
  // something's going on...

#+end_src

- If the file exists ~H5Fcreate~ will fail and ~H5Fopen~ with ~H5F_ACC_RDWR~
  will kick in.
  - If the file is not an HDF5 file, both will fail.
- If the file does not exist, ~H5Fcreate~ will do its job.

** Your questions (as of 9:00 a.m. Central Time)
*** Question 1
#+begin_quote
Is there a limit on array size if I save an array as an attribute of a dataset?

In terms of the performance, is there any consequence if I save a large amount
of data into an attribute?
#+end_quote

- Size limit :: No, not in newer versions (1.8.x+) of HDF5. See [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48808714][What limits are there in HDF5?]]
  - Make sure that downstream applications can handle such attributes (i.e., use
    HDF5 1.8.x or later)
  - Remember to tell the library that you want to use the 1.8 or later file
    format via [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5F_SET_LIBVER_BOUNDS][~H5Fset_libverbounds~]] (e.g., set ~low~ to ~H5F_LIBVER_V18~)
  - Also keep an eye on [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5P_SET_ATTR_PHASE_CHANGE][~H5Pset_attr_phase_change~]] (Consider setting ~max_compact~ to 0.)
- Performance :: It depends. (...on what you mean by /performance/)
  - Attributes have a different function (from datasets) in HDF5
    - They "decorate" other objects - application metadata
  - Their values are treated as atomic units, i.e., you will always write and
    read the entire "large" value.
    - In other words, you lose partial I/O
    - Several layouts available for datasets are not supported with attributes
      - No compression

*** Question 2
#+begin_quote
Question regarding hdf5 I/O performance, compare saving data into a large array
in one dataset Vs saving data into several smaller arrays and in several
dataset. Any consequence in terms of the performance? Will there be any sweet
spot for best performance? Or any tricks to make it reading/writing faster? I
know parallel I/O but parallel I/O would need hardware support which is not
always available. So the question is about the tricks to speed up I/O without
parallel I/O.
#+end_quote

- One large dataset vs. many small datasets, which is faster? :: It depends.
  - How do you access the data?
    - Do you always write/read the entire array in the order it was written?
    - Is it WORM (write once read many)?
      - How and how frequently does it change?
  - How compressible is the data?
    - Do you need to store data at all? E.g., [[https://www.hdfgroup.org/2021/02/webinar-learn-about-data-virtualization-with-hdf5-udf-and-how-it-can-streamline-your-work-materials/][HDF5-UDF]]
  - What is performance for you and how do you measure it?
  - What percentage of total runtime does your application spend doing I/O?
  - What scalability behavior do you expect?
  - Assuming throughput is the measure, create a baseline for your target
    system, for example, via [[https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html][FIO]] or [[https://github.com/hpc/ior][IOR]]
    - Your goal is to saturate the I/O subsystem
    - Is this a dedicated system?
  - Which other systems do you need to support? Are you the only user? What's
    the future?
  - **What's the budget?**

- The user created a compound type with 100s of fields and eventually saw this
  error:
  #+begin_example
H5Oalloc.c line 1312 in H5O__alloc(): object header message is too large
  #+end_example
- This issue was first raised (Jira-ticket HDFFV-1089 date) on  Jun 08, 2009
- **Root cause:** the size of header message data is represented in a 2 byte
  unsigned integer (see section IV.A.1.a and IV.A.1.b of the [[https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/File+Format+Specification][HDF5 file format spec.]])
  - Ergo, header messages, currently, cannot be larger than 64 KB.
  - Datatype information is stored in a header message (see section IV.A.2.d)
  - This can be fixed with a file format update, but it's /fallen through the
    cracks/ for over 10 years
- The customer is always right, but who needs 100s of fields in a compound type?
  - _Use Case_: You have a large record type and you always (or most of the
    time) read and write all fields together.
  - Outside this narrow use case you are bound to lose a lot of performance and
    flexibility
- You are Leaving the +American Sector+ Mainstream: not too many tools will be
  able to handle your data
- Better approach: divide-and-conquer, i.e., go w/ a group of compounds or

** Your questions
*** [[https://github.com/steven-varga/h5rnd][h5rnd]]
- **Question:** How are generated HDF5 objects named?  An integer name, or can a
  randomized string be used?
  - =h5rnd= Generates a pool of random strings as link names
  - Uniform length distribution between 5 and 30 over =[a-z][A-Z]=

- **Question:** Does it create multi-dimensional datasets with a rich set of
  HDF5 datatypes?  Compound datatypes, perhaps?
  - Currently, it creates 1,000 element 1D FP64 datasets (w/ attribute)
  - RE: types - anything is possible. Budget?

  which is not yet created and this should be done inside the C++ code..can you
  please tell me how can I use this inside this tool

- The emphasis  appears to be on C++
  - You can do this in C. It's just more boilerplate.
  - Whenever I need something C++, I turn to my colleague Steven Varga (=

    break;
  case H5O_TYPE_DATASET:
    err = H5Ocopy(src, name, *dst, name, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
    break;
  default: /*H5O_TYPE_NAMED_DATATYPE, H5O_TYPE_NTYPES, H5O_TYPE_UNKNOWN */

*** Parting thoughts
- This is can be tricky business depending on how selective you want to be
- ~H5Ovisit~ visits /objects/ and does not account for dangling links, etc.
- ~H5Ocopy~'s behavior is highly customizable. Check the options & play w/
  =h5copy= to see the effect!

*** More Questions
**** Question 1
#+begin_quote
I have an unrelated question. I have 7,000 HDF5 files, each 500 MB long. When I
use them, should I open them selectively, when I need them, or is it
advantageous to make one big file, or to open virtual files? I am interested in
the speed of the different approaches.
#+end_quote

- 40 GbE connectivity
- 10 contiguously laid out Datasets per file => ~50 MB per dataset
- Always reading full datasets
- **Considerations:**
  - If you have the RAM and use all data in an "epoch" just read whole files and
    use [[https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/Advanced/FileImageOperations/HDF5FileImageOperations.pdf][HDF5 file images]] for "in-memory I/O."
  - You could maintain an index file /I/ which contains external links (one for
    each of the 7,000 files), and a dataset which for each external file and
    dataset contains the offset of the dataset in the file. You would keep /I/
    (small!) in memory and, for each dataset request, read the ~50MB directly
    w/o the HDF5 library. This assumes that no datatype conversion is necessary
    and you have no trouble interpreting the bytes.
  - A variation of the previous approach would be for the stub-file to contain
    HDF5 [[https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/jpss/documents/HDF5_Tutorial_201509/2-3-Working%20with%20collections%20of%20HDF5%20files.pptx.pdf][/virtual datasets/]], datasets stitched together from other
    datasets. This would we a good option, if you wanted to simplify your
    application code and make everything appear as a single large HDF5
    file. It'd be important though to have that (small) stub-file on the clients
    in memory to not incur a high latency penalty.
  - Both approaches can be easily parallelized, assuming read-only access. If
    there are writers involved, it's still doable, but additional considerations
    apply.

#+begin_quote
Another question: what is the recommended way to combine Python with C++ with
C++ reading in and working on large hdf5 files that require a lot of speed.
#+end_quote

- To be honest, we ran out of time and I (GH) didn't fully grasp the question.
- Steven said something about Julia
- Henric uses Boost Python.  What about Cython?
- What's the access pattern?

                  specified on the command line and reference datasets are
                  populated with correct reference values. Copies of referenced
                  datasets outside the copy range specified on the command line
                  will normally have a different name from the original.
                    (Default:Without this option, reference value(s) in any
                  reference datasets are set to NULL and referenced objects are
                  not copied unless they are otherwise within the copy range
                  specified on the command line.)

      noattr      Copy object without copying attributes

*** Forum
- [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/hdfql-2-3-0-release-with-excel-import-export-support/8132][Release of HDFql 2.3.0]]
  - Excel import and export (no Excel or OLE dependency!)
- [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/creating-a-dataset-through-external-link-does-not-allow-hdf5view-to-see-resulting-dataset-from-root-file/8148][Possible bug in HDFView]]
  - Based on the description, it appears that external links are not properly
    traversed
  - Waiting for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example][MWE]]
- [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/possible-bug-with-hyperslab-selection-in-1-10-7/8164][Possible hyperslab selection bug in 1.10.7]]
  - It appears that =H5S_SELECT_OR= is no longer "commutative", i.e., ~H5Dread~
    with =SelA OR SelB= works, but not =SelB OR SelA=
  - Wasn't there in 1.10.6
** Notes
*** What (if any) are the ACID properties of HDF5 operations?
**** Split-state
The state of an open (for RW) HDF5 file is /split/ between RAM and persistent
storage. Often the partial states will be out of sync. In the event of a
"catastrophic" failure (power outage, application crash, system crash), it is
impossible to predict what the partial state on disk will be.

#+begin_src plantuml :hidden :file hdf5-file-state.png
skinparam componentStyle rectangle

package "HDF5 File State" {
  database "Disk" {
    [Partial State 1]
  }
  cloud "RAM" {
    [Partial State 2]
  }
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:hdf5-file-state.png]]

**** Non-transactional
The main reason why it is impossible to predict the outcome is that HDF5
operations are non-transactional. By 'transaction' I mean a collection of
operations (and the effects of their execution) on the physical and abstract
application state. In particular, there are no concepts of beginning a
transaction, a commit, or a roll-back. Since they are not transactional, it is
not straightforward to speak about the ACID properties of HDF5 operations.

**** File system facilities
People sometimes speak about ACID properties with respect to file system
operations. Although the HDF5 library relies on file system operations for the
implementation of HDF5 operations, the correspondence is not as direct as
might wish. For example, what appears as a single HDF5 operation to the user
often includes multiple file system operations. Several file system operations
have a certain property only at the level of a single operation, but not
multiple operations combined.

**** ACID
- Atomicity :: All changes to an HDF5 file's state must complete or fail as a
  whole unit.
  - Supported in HDF5? **No.**
  - Some file systems only support single op. atomicity, if at all.
  - A lot of HDF5 operations are /in-place/; mixed success -> impossible to
    recover
- Consistency :: An operation is a correct transformation of the HDF5 file's
  state.
  - Supported in HDF5? **Yes and No**
  - Depends on one's definition of HDF5 file/object integrity constraints
  - Assuming we are dealing with a correct program
  - Special case w/ multiple processes: Single Writer Multiple Reader
- Isolation (serialization) :: Even though operations execute concurrently, it
  appears to each operation, OP, that others executed either before OP or after
  OP, but not both.
  - Supported in HDF5? **No.**
  - Depends on concurrency scenario and requires special configuration (e.g.,
    MT, MPI).
  - Time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability
- Durability :: Once an operation completes successfully, it's changes to the
  file's state survive failure.
  - Supported in HDF5? **No.**
  - "Split brain"
  - No transaction log

**THIS MEETING IS BEING RECORDED** and the recording will be available on The
HDF Group's [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhtsIZquL3r-zH-R-r9-tQ][YouTube channel]]. Remember to subscribe!

** Goal(s)
** This is a meeting dedicated to /your/ questions.
** In the unlikely event there aren't any
We have a few prepared topics (forum posts, announcements, etc.)
** Sometimes life deals you an HDF5 file
No question is too small. We are here to learn. All of us.

** Meeting Etiquette
** Be social, turn on your camera (if you've got one)
Talking to black boxes isn't fun.

** Raise your hand to signal a contribution (question, comment)
Mute yourself while others are speaking, be ready to participate.

** Be mindful of your "airtime"
We want to cover as many of your topics as possible. Be fair to others.

** Introduce yourself
1. Your Name
2. Your affiliation/organization/group
3. One reason why you are here today

** Use the shared Google doc for questions and code snippets
The [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17j7MsAdNdCLxxWA_PtXv3jTgWDTqOm2uTk5jHCj8zXM/edit][link]] can be found in the chat window.

** When the 30 min. timer runs out, this meeting is over.
Continue the discussion on the [[https://forum.hdfgroup.org/][HDF Forum]] or come back next week!
